      <h2>The Rules of War</h2>
      <h4>The Goal</h4>
      <p>Win the entire deck of cards.</p>
      <h4>Setup</h4>
      <p>A full 52-card deck is dealt evenly to two players.</p>
      <h4>Play &amp; Winning</h4>
      <p>Each player draws their top card and places it face up. Whoever has the highest-ranked card wins both cards back to their deck. Repeat until a player has won all 52 cards (meaning their opponent has 0 cards). The player with all the cards has won!</p>
      <h4>Card Ranks</h4>
      <p>Cards are ranked in descending order as such: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.</p>
      <h4>War</h4>
      <p>In the event of a tie (i.e. two cards of the same rank), a War ensues. In the War, each player plays their next card facedown. They each then play a second card faceup. The higher-ranked card wins all the cards in the war. If the next cards played are of equal rank, the War repeats. The player with the higher-ranked card wins every card played in the War. For example, if there is only one tie, the winner of the War takes in six cards; if there are two ties, they take in ten; three ties, fourteen, and so on. </p>
